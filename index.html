        <p style="font-size: large;">If you are a car dealer, you would probably know how dealerships are experiencing low footfall. But do you know the reason behind that? It’s because modern-day car buyers prefer to go through a dealership`s website first. You need a useful car dealer website design to drive traffic and engage with your potential customers. 

            That being said, you can’t develop a website on your own. You will need professional expertise through a web development agency. With expert knowledge, you can gauge what your potential audience requires. Your car dealer website design should resonate with your business theme. For instance, if you deal in luxury cars, vintage cars, or an exclusive dealership of a particular car manufacturer.</p> <br><br>
           <h3>The Importance Of A Responsive Car Dealer Website Design</h3> <p>As the digital advertising landscape is rampantly increasing, so are consumer patterns for car dealerships. 

            Here are some of the statistics to show why the car dealership requires a useful website and, subsequently, an engaging website design.</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Only one in three potential car buyers know the exact vehicle that they want to purchase.</li>
                <li>95% of vehicle buyers use digital tools as a source of information</li>
                <li>Two times as many automotive consumers start their research online versus at a dealer</li>
                <li>76% of new and used vehicle shoppers run a Google search before buying.</li>
                <li>Automobile consumers visit an average of 4.2 websites in their purchasing process.</li>
                <li>The average automotive shopper spends 33% of their research time on a mobile device.</li>
                <li>Car buyers spend an average of approximately 14 hours online during their search.</li></ul>
                <p>With these statistics, you can easily comprehend the significance of having a car dealership website. It’s because no matter how great your cars are, without a digital presence, you won’t be able to get the word out</p>
                <h3>Responsiveness is a Key Feature</h3>
                <p>Today, 60% of car buyers access dealership websites from their mobile phones, similar to most eCommerce websites. That is why, to impress your customers, you need to create a seamless mobile navigation experience for them.

                    When a potential customer visits a dealership website, they want to get the maximum information possible for whatever they are looking for. You need a simple and rather elegant website to facilitate potential customers so:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Customers can quickly scan through your website, which drives more traffic. Because customers looking for a car won`t have the time to go through the website in detail. 
                            </li><LI>You can provide a better user experience, with a well-segmented and more comfortable-to-read home page. Customers expect an aesthetically pleasing theme along with formatted visual content.</LI>
                    </ul>
